#  Project Title: To-Do List with LocalStorage

This project was specifically designed for practicing how to use **localStorage**.  
It stores an **array** containing the tasks, where each task is an **object** with the following properties:

- `id`: a unique identifier  
- `title`: the task title  
- `completed`: a boolean value to check if the task is marked as completed or not  

The project also focuses on **extensive use of functions** for training purposes and avoiding code repetition.

>  **Note:**  
> You may notice that the upload dates of my projects are very close to each other.  
> That's because I started learning **Git** after I had already finished learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
> I had several older projects, so I decided to review and improve the code of one project each day, and then upload it.  
> That's why Iâ€™m uploading one project per day.
